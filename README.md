# Restaurant

A single page app for a fictional restaurant using ES6 modules and Webpack.

- Link to deployment

## About

- Odin link
- Brief description - es6 modules, webpack, dyanmic js

## API / How this works

- Each major component (header, footing and each of the three pages) is a separate module
- initalise bootstraps site
- index adds listners to change pages
- All\* variables are stored in the data file. To change or add a product, heading, copy etc just find the relevant variable in the file and it will update across the site

## Reflections

- Reasonably happy with design / responsiveness / looks
- Probably slightly over-engineered but fine as it was good practice
- Probably wouldn't actually build a site of this size this way
- Initially didn't love the idea of adding a build step just to use modules but webpack was reasonably painless once set up
- Nice to go back to writing code in modules

## To Do

- [ ] Convert menu to hamburger menu on small screens

## Issues

- Google map load is slow. But also free.
- CSS needs refactoring
- Header and footer need refactoring
- Classes could be cleaned up and broken down into smaller functions
